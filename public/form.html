<p>Hello Guys here is something basic that you can do with your css</p>
<form>
<span class="colored-fonts">First Name:</span><input type="text" name="fname" class="spaced-input"/>
<br>
<span class="colored-fonts">Last Name:</span><input type="text" name="lname" class="spaced-input"/>
<br>
<span class="colored-fonts">Some Number:</span><input type="number" name="number"class="spaced-input"/>
<br>
<span class="colored-fonts">Some Date:</span><input type="date" name="date" class="spaced-input"/>
<br>
<input type="submit" value"enter" class="style-submit"/>
</form>
<h2>Now let's design a paragraph with the css</h2>
<p>Let's see what we can really do with css Let's say you want to capitalliaze all your friends name <span class="capital-txt">tom,harvey,bruce</span> you need not  to always type them in <span class="capital-txt forced-font">capital letters</span></p>
<p>Let's say you want to make a line italic but you don't really know that how the line will look if it is italic,bold or normal so here comes css that let's you transform font-style quick and simple</p>
<p class="family-simple">This is a simple line text</p>
<p class="family-italic">This is a italic text</p>
<p class="family-bold">This is a bold text</p>

<p>Trust me css is quite a nice tool if you are decorating your site</p>
